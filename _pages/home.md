<span class="font-weight-bold">About Me:</span><br>
Welcome to my research profile! I am a passionate cancer researcher with a keen academic interest in the application of the concepts of game theory and fitness landscape in understanding cancer biology. My work revolves around understanding cancer drug resistance and developing innovative strategies to overcome it.  

Academic Journey:

Throughout my academics and research career I have been actively seeking to gain new experiences and knowledge in various area of cancer research. Early in my career as a graduate student, I studied the association between PIK3CA mutation and clinical parameters from samples obtained from breast cancer patients. In addition, I have investigated drug sensitivity profile of HER2+ cell lines to various compounds to provide knowledge about drugs that show better response. 

From there my interest in cancer drug resistance was born and I pursued my PhD study. My PhD research was focused on the identification of anti-cancer compounds that specifically targets BCR-Abl positive chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) while sparing the normal cells. In order to achieve this, I have designed and optimized a co-culture based high-throughput screening platform.

Currently, I am working as postdoctoral researcher affiliated with the [Rayner’s lab](https://www.ous-research.no/rayner/?k=rayner%2FGroup+members&aid=16879) at the Department of Medical Genetics, Norway and [Scott’s lab](https://www.lerner.ccf.org/translational-hematology-oncology/scott/) at Cleveland Clinic, USA. For more information about my current work visit the project section.

Empowering the Next Generation: 

Alongside my research, I am passionate about mentoring the next generation of cancer researchers. I have supervised several graduate students, nurtured their scientific curiosity and encouraging them to explore innovative approaches to tackle cancer drug resistance and improve cancer treatment outcomes. 

Collaborations and Partnerships: 

To enhance the potential impact of research and bridge the gap between theory and real-life applications collaboration between diverse area of expertise is crucial. In order to achieve this I have initiated collaboration with [Dr. Maximilian](https://theorydi.vision/ppl-maximilianstrobl.html) and [Dr. Sara](https://researchportal.tuni.fi/en/persons/sara-hamis).

<p align="justify"> In this post, I’m excited to share the remarkable and unconventional academic journey of Mina Dinh, a talented PhD candidate I've had the pleasure of working with for the past 3.5 years. Her path exemplifies the flexibility of the U.S. education and research system, which fosters the next generation of innovators and technology pioneers. </p>

<p align="center"> <span class="font-weight-bold"> Unique start in Biochemistry, applied Maths and Education </span> </p>

<p align="justify"> Mina's academic career began with an undergraduate degree in Biochemistry, complemented by minors in Applied Math and Education at the University of Washington. Her research journey came early, during her first year at the University, working as a clinical research assistant on prostate and bladder cancer clinical trials. This opportunity, alongside the mentorship of a principal investigator with a research lab, allowed Mina to explore and gain hands-on experience in Molecular Biology. By her sophomore year, she was already working in a protein design lab, investigating the details of chemically and light-induced protein dimerization, strengthening her wet lab experiences. </p>

<p align="justify"> Next, driven by a desire to delve into computational research projects, Mina applied for a summer undergraduate research program in Systems Biology and Computational Oncology at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). This program not only provided financial support for 10 weeks but also a pivotal research experience in cancer biology and evolution, marking a major turning point in her career. The work that she was part of during the summer program in Tampa, Florida, has been published and is available <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6665681/">here</a>. Mina recalls the invaluable mentorship from Dr. Gatenby, Dr. Sandy, and Dr. Brown, which not only shaped her research direction but also instilled in her a desire to mentor and support others in the lab. </p>

<p align="justify"> After completing her undergraduate studies, Mina joined Scott's lab at the Cleveland Clinic as a lab technician, initially with the intention of attending medical school. A year into the role, she secured an NIH diversity grant to support her research and academic progress. During my time working alongside her, it became clear that Mina possesses a rare combination of dedication, attention to detail, and a natural talent for experimental design and data analysis. After three years as a technician, Mina transitioned into a PhD program in Molecular Medicine, as part of Scott's lab. The Cleveland Clinic’s Molecular Medicine PhD program is uniquely designed to allow candidates to transition to medical school. Thus, PhD students work with clinical mentors and gain invaluable shadowing experience, providing a comprehensive clinical exposure. Choosing such a demanding and competitive career path is a significant commitment, requiring mental strength, passion for science, and a solid support system from family, friends, and colleagues. With this regard, Mina is grateful for all the support, encouragement and opportunities she has received along the way.  </p>

<p align="justify">  Finally, I asked what drives her to pursue such a challenging career path, confidently, Mina replied “research and science offers me an opportunity and freedom to do what I want to do passionately and innovate new technologies that is impacts the society”. Therefore, if we need to build a research system that is robust, problem solving and innovative the way forward is to provide an opportunity for young talents at an early stage to enhance and promote academic excellence and academic freedom! Mina's journey is a testament to the importance of fostering hands-on experience, mentorship, and curiosity at an early academic stage is a pilar to pursue a successful research career and keep young talents in research. Doing so not only shapes the scientific community in the positive direction, but also adds flavor and spices it up! Looking back on my time in Cleveland, the experience is mind-blowing! </p>
